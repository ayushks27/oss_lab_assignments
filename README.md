l1q2.c : A C program that reads an array of integers from the user, calculates the average of the integers, and prints
the result.

l1q3.c : A C program that takes a string input from the user and reverses the string.

l1bq2.c : A C program that reads a matrix of integers from the user, calculates the transpose of the matrix, and prints the result.

l1bq3.c : A C program that takes a paragraph input from the user, counts the frequency of each word in the paragraph, and prints the frequencies.

dijkstra.c : Dijkstra Algorithm for Finding Minimum Distance of Vertices from a Given Source in a Graph, providing how each functions works in upcoming paragarph.

             toLowerCase() -> Converts a string to lowercase to make word counting case-insensitive.
             fgets() input	-> Reads the paragraph including spaces.
             Newline removal -> Removes trailing newline from input for clean processing.
             strtok() tokenizer	-> Splits paragraph into words using multiple delimiters (spaces, punctuation).
             Word frequency loop	-> Tracks each unique word and counts occurrences in parallel arrays.
             Output printing -> Prints each word with its frequency count.
